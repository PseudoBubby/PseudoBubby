- 👋 Hi, I’m @PseudoBubby
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Software Engineering, AI, and (as a hobby outside of computer science) Music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you'd like! I'm still learning, but I'd be glad to collaborate on any Python project you'd like. Not a big fan of Java, though.
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me on GitHub.
